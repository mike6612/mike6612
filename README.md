### Hi, I'm Michael ! 

üè´ I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Illinois Chicago.

My passion for creating software solutions began when I had the privilege of attending Harvard Summer School through Summer of a Lifetime, where I was a part of a pre-college Harvard curriculum focused on computer science. It was an ineffable experience-I interacted with classmates and was captivated by the idea of building code for impactful initiatives.

This curiosity has followed me through my pursuit of higher education at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I have become comfortable working with several programming languages and continue to build a strong foundation in software principles and technical skills. Currently, I am working with React and Three.js to develop an innovative platform that educates individuals about the exoplanetary systems of our universe.
